Hi there!

I am trying my hands on some of the nlp tutorials lying around the place. I am inspired by the this medium [article](https://medium.com/activewizards-machine-learning-company/comparison-of-top-6-python-nlp-libraries-c4ce160237eb) that lists the popular nlp libraries as well as this other [article](https://12ft.io/proxy?&q=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40miranthaj%2F25-nlp-tasks-at-a-glance-52e3fdff32e2) that lists NLP tasks.

Libraries I intend to cover are
- huggingface : https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1
- nltk : https://realpython.com/nltk-nlp-python/
- spacy : https://github.com/explosion/spacy-course/tree/master/chapters/en , https://course.spacy.io/en/chapter1
- genism : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp-gensim-tutorial-complete-guide-for-beginners/
- sklearn(nlp) : https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html
- pattern :  https://github.com/clips/pattern/wiki/pattern-en
- polyglot : https://github.com/aboSamoor/polyglot

Hopefully through the end of this I will appreciate the differences, the features of each of the libraries and what are they best suited for.
